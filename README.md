# Templex-Properties-Python
This code computes the properties of a templex: homology groups, orientability chains, joining loci and stripexes, as in Charó, G. D., Letellier, C., &amp; Sciamarella, D. (2022). Templex: A bridge between homologies and templates for chaotic attractors. Then the computation of the fundamental dynamic units was added.
